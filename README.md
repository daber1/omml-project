# MARINA and DIANA - 2 girls for unbiased compression

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the MARINA and DIANA project - a project aimed at developing unbiased compression algorithms. 

## Description

The MARINA and DIANA project focuses on creating compression algorithms that are unbiased in their performance. Traditional compression algorithms tend to favor certain types of data, leading to suboptimal results in compressing other types of data. MARINA and DIANA aim to address this issue by developing algorithms that provide efficient compression for any type of data.
